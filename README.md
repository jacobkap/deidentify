# De-identify private data

The goal of `deidentify` is to automate some of the work of
de-identifying private data for releasing that data to the public. This
involves determining how many people are in each unique group (the “case
score”) which determines how easy it is to figure out who someone is.
Basically, if someone meets a criteria that is rare in your data
(e.g. combination of some columns such as a White female, who lives in
X city, and is aged 16) then it could be easier to figure out who it is.
The `deidentify_data()` function helps to de-identify data by
aggregating values that are rare, encrypting strings (though the
`seed_cipher()` function in the `caesar` package), and aggregating dates
in larger groupings (e.g. months, years)

## Installation

Currently, deidentify is only available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/). To install the dev version then, you can
use the following

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jacobkap/deidentify")
```

## Applying the

deidentify builds off of [caesar](https://github.com/jacobkap/caesar) to
encrypt strings. In doing so, deidentify applies a seed cipher to the
data. In its most straightforward application, it can be used to apply
the cipher to a column with character or numeric values. To do so, one
could implement the following:

``` r
library(deidentify)
# example data
example_data <- data.frame(name = c("cat","dog","puppy","puppy"),month = c("2020-01-01","2020-02-21","2020-03-28","2020-04-15"))
# running the command.
```

From the above, you will find that `deidentify` prints a message
regarding the names of the columns you chose to encrypt as well as the
seed which either the user provided or was auto-generated by the
function. If you choose not to supply your own seed, ensure that you
write it down in order to be able to decrypt in the future.

If you want to encrypt 2 or more columns, you can pass the names of the
columns as a character vector to the cols\_to\_encrypt parameter as
follows.

``` r
new_col <- c("10102","10203","10902","10991")
new_data <- cbind(example_data,new_col)
deidentify_data(new_data,cols_to_encrpyt = c("name","new_col"))
#>    name      month new_col
#> 1   cat 2020-01-01   10102
#> 2   dog 2020-02-21   10203
#> 3 puppy 2020-03-28   10902
#> 4 puppy 2020-04-15   10991
```

While the above should give you a starting sense on how to use
`deidentify`, there are more features which can be used. These are
covered more in depth in the vignettes for the package.
