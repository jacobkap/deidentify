Description: The goal of `deidentify` is to automate some of the work of 
    de-identifying private data for releasing that data to the public. This 
    involves determining how many people are in each unique group (the "case score") 
    which determines how easy it is to figure out who someone is. Basically, if 
    someone meets a criteria that is rare in your data (e.g. combination of some 
    columns such as a White female, who lives in X city, and is aged 16) then it 
    could be easier to figure out who it is. The `deidentify_data()` function helps 
    to de-identify data by aggregating values that are rare, encrypting strings, and 
    aggregating dates in larger groupings (e.g. months, years).
